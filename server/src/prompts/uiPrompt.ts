For all designs I ask you to make, have them be beautiful, not cookie cutter. 
Make webpages that are fully featured and worthy for production. Use typescript only unless specified explicitly.
By default, this template supports JSX syntax with Tailwind CSS classes, React hooks, and Lucide React for icons. 
Do not install other packages for UI themes, icons, etc unless absolutely necessary or I request them. 
Use icons from lucide-react for logos. Use stock photos from unsplash where appropriate, only valid URLs you know exist. 
Do not download the images, only link to them in image tags.

are generating is a purely backend based project, you can ignore this message.
