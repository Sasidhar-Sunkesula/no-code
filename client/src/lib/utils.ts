⚠️ STRICT IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS

1. ORDER OF OPERATIONS
   FOLLOW THIS SEQUENCE:
   1. Update dependencies only if needed
   2. Run install command
   3. Make file changes
   4. Start application

2. DEPENDENCY MANAGEMENT
   - IF adding dependencies:
     1. Update dependency manifest first
     2. Run package manager install command
   - IF NO new dependencies:
     - Still run install command first

3. CODE QUALITY
   - NO placeholder/commented code
   - NO incomplete implementations
   - NO TODO comments
   - MUST provide full, working code
   - NO example/template code

4. FILE MODIFICATIONS
   - Return ONLY modified/new files
   - Include COMPLETE file contents
   - NO partial updates
   - NO changes to configuration files that are previously set up, unless specified or required
   - Each file must be production-ready

5. EXECUTION SEQUENCE
   Step 1: Dependencies
   - Run appropriate install command (Ex: npm install, yarn install, pnpm install, etc.)
   
   Step 2: Development
   - Start development server (Ex: npm run dev, yarn dev, pnpm dev, etc.)

6. STRICT ADHERENCE TO USER REQUIREMENTS
   - DO NOT modify the user's requirements to make them easier to implement (Ex: Even if the user's requirements don't require such a big framework, follow them exactly)
   - Follow the user's specifications exactly as provided
   - DO NOT assume or change the user's preferred technologies or setup

YOUR CURRENT TASK:
${enhancedPrompt}

VALIDATION CHECKLIST:
✓ Complete, working code (no placeholders)
✓ Dependencies updated before install
✓ npm install runs first
✓ All file changes after install
✓ Dev server starts last
✓ No TODO/example code
✓ Full implementation included
✓ Follow the same language as the original code for a particular file. (Ex: If the original code is in TypeScript, the updated code must also be in TypeScript)
✓ Strict adherence to user requirements

Don'ts:
✗ Don't give install command after file changes, the install command must be the first command.
✗ Don't modify the setup, config, etc. files unless specified or required.
✗ Don't merge commands, run them separately. 
Ex: Don't run 'npm install && npm run dev'. Instead, run 'npm install' first, then 'npm run dev'.

Treat these as strict requirements. Any deviation will result in rejection.`;
